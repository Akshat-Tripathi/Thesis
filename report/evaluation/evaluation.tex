\chapter{Evaluation Plan}

I plan to evaluate this thesis by simulating many different scenarios, varying the paths the robots will take, the number of attackers in the system, the types of attackers in the system and if I find multiple defences, then varying the different defences too. From these runs, I will compute an error metric measuring the deviation of each robot from its actual path. I then plan to compare the results to scenarios where there are no attackers, no defences and no Robot Web, to see how each effect the localisation of the robots.

I hope to observe that the defences I will implement are effective at preventing attackers from being able to influence the network, this would mean that the case where there are no attackers would have a similar error to the case where there are attackers and defences.

I also hope that the defences are not invasive, and so wouldn't require major changes to the hardware of robots. This includes computational resources, which are likely to be limited.

I would also like to evaluate the defences in a real-world environment.
