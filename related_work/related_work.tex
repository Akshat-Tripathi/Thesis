\chapter{Related Work}

% There are several different techniques that have been explored in preventing these types of identity based attacks
% In this chapter, we will examine several of these methods

\section{Wifi Scattering}
Explain what wifi scattering is - how wifi signals propagate, etc

\subsection{Paper 1 - Gil et al.}
This paper uses multipath scattering - explain what it is
Explain how they generate the fingerprint and how they use it to combat sybil and masquerade attacks.

Present their findings


\subsection{Paper 2 - Huang et al.}

Explain how they generate a fingerprint and how they use it to combat sybil and masquerade attacks

Present their findings

\subsection{Conclusions}

Talk about what's wrong with the papers/what can be done to break the attack

\section{Proof of Work}
Explain how proof of work usually works (blockchain context)

\subsection{Paper series 1 - Gupta et al.}
Explain what problems w PoW they find

Explain how they solve them + the results

\subsection{Paper series 2 - Strobel et al.}

Explain what problems w PoW they find

Explain how they solve them + the results

\subsection{Conclusions}

\section{Attacks on sensor networks}
