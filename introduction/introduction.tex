\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Objectives}
I want to allow multiple robots, owned by different people, with different goals to be able to safely operate in the same environment. To do this they need to be able to communicate. They can communicate for several different reasons, they could talk about where they think each other is, they could share information about what they've seen (map info) or share information about obstacles they see/perform sanity checks on each other (tesla example). They could even tell each other their near-term plans, in order path plan better. 

Now, this sounds utopian, but we must first remember that bad actors exist and will attack this system, so we must be prepared. Bad actors may have many different goals, in space mining they merely could seek to hoard good asteroids for themselves, whereas terrorists could aim to cause multiple car crashes.

Some research in this field has been done (cite robotweb and the non orca paper), and yet there is still so much more to be done. 

I stand at the foot of this mountain, seeking to take my first steps.

\section{Contributions}
Currently, the main contributions of this paper are the background research that has been done, and some (not included) preliminary results on the effectiveness of some attacks. This is subject to change with time.
